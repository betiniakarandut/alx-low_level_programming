# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Description :house:
In this project, I began to learn about
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

# Tasks :pencil:
| task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [0. Linear search](./0-linear.c) | Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm|
| [1. Binary search](./1-binary.c) | Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm|
| [2. Big O #0](./2-O) | What is the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n?|
| [3. Big O #1](./3-O) | What is the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n?|
| [4. Big O #2](./4-O) | What is the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n?|
